![Inspect Pane](../images/agg3.png "Inspect Pane")

The Inspect Pane is enabled on most data transformations, with the exception of Source, Sink and Union.

This widget provides a view into the metadata of the data stream that you are transforming. You will be able to see the column counts, columns changed, columns added, data types, column ordering and column references. This is a read-only view of your metadata.
