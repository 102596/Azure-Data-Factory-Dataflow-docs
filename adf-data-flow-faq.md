* Q: Which ADF version do I use to create Data Flows?

* Q: I was a previous private preview customer using Data Flows and I used the ADF V2 w/Data Flows preview version
  A: This version is now obsolete. Use ADF V2 for Data Flows
  
* Q: What has changed from private preview to limited public preview in Data Flows?
  A: You will no longer have to bring your own Databricks clusters. ADF will manage cluster creation and tear-down. Blob datasets and ADLS datasets are separated into Delimited Text and Parquet datasets. You can still use ADLS & Blob Store to store those files. Use the appropriate Linked Service for those storage engines.
