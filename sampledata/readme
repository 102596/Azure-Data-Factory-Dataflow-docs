The sample data files found in this folder are free for your use in Azure Data Factory Data Flows to experiment and play with.

Upload the files to your Azure Blob Storage and point to them with an ADF Linked Service + Dataset as part of defining a Data Flow Source transform.

To use the ARM Template with samoples from repo, make sure to first create a container called "demo".
