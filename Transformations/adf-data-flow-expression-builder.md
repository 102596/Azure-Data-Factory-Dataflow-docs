# Azure Data Factory Data Flow Transformations

## Expression Builder

In ADF Data Flow, you will find expression boxes when you can enter expressions for data transformation that utilizes columns, fields, variables, parameters, functions from your data flow. To build the expression, you use the Expression Builder, which can be launched by clicking in the expression text box within each transformation. You will also sometimes see "Computed Column" options when selecting columns for transformation. When you click that, you will also see the Expression Builder launched.

The Expression Builder tool defaults to the text editor option with auto-complete from the entire ADF Data Flow object model with syntax checking and highlighting.
