Azure Data Factory Data Flow
Transformations
Source

The Source transformation configures a data source that you wish to use to bring data into your data flow. You may have more than 1 Source transform in a single Data Flow.

Options


AllowSchemaDrift
Select Allow Schema Drift if the source columns will change often. This setting will allow all incoming fields from your source to flow through the transformations to the Sink.

schemaValidation
Choose this option to enforce a Source schema validation that will fail your Data Flow if columns that are expected from your source are not present.

Sampling
Use Sampling to limit the number of rows from your Source.  This is useful when you need just a sample of your source data for testing and debugging purposes.
